abstract: "Do higher education job postings demonstrate a preoccupation with equity values, at the expense of other values? And has the value emphasis changed in recent years? Other important values have historically been prioritized in American education, including quality, efficiency, equity, and choice. In this project we employ a text-as-data approach to analyze the prevalence of values in nearly 67,000 education faculty job postings from 2016 to 2024. Using machine learning models, validated with a novel human coding, we find that equity values are far more prevalent than other values in higher education job postings, reaching a peak in 2022. "
